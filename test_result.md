# FlowSpace Testing Results

## Testing Protocol
- Backend testing: Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` tool
- Frontend testing: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` tool  
- Always read this file before invoking testing agents
- Update this file after testing completion

## Current Status
**Date:** 2025-11-07
**Status:** ✅ Backend Card Operations & Activity Logging - ALL TESTS PASSING

## Backend Testing Results (2025-11-07 20:27 UTC)

### Test Summary: 10/10 Tests Passed ✅

- ✅ Card created successfully with correct status code (201)
- ✅ Card fields validated (title, description, columnId, boardId, tags)
- ✅ Card persisted to database

#### 2. Card Retrieval (GET /api/cards/:boardId/cards)
- ✅ Cards retrieved successfully for board
- ✅ Response structure correct with 'cards' array
- ✅ Created card found in response

#### 3. Card Update (PUT /api/cards/:id)
- ✅ Card updated successfully with correct status code (200)
- ✅ Updated fields persisted correctly
- ✅ Card data matches update request

#### 4. Activity Logging
- ✅ Card creation activity logged with correct fields (entityType='card', entityId=cardId)
- ✅ Card update activity logged successfully
- ✅ Card deletion activity logged successfully
- ✅ User data populated in activities (name, email)
- ✅ Activities retrieved via GET /api/activity

#### 5. Card Deletion (DELETE /api/cards/:id)
- ✅ Card deleted successfully with correct status code (200)
- ✅ Card removed from database (verified)
- ✅ Deletion activity logged

### Technical Details
- **Backend URL:** http://localhost:8001
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens working correctly
- **Database:** MongoDB activities collection verified
- **Activity Fields:** entityType, entityId, userId, boardId, action all correct
- **Socket.io:** Events emitted for card:create, card:update, card:delete
- **User Population:** Activity userId properly populated with user details

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Fixed socket event naming mismatch (card:created → card:create)
2. ✅ Fixed activity logging field names (targetType/targetId → entityType/entityId)
3. ✅ Updated cardsController to broadcast card events via Socket.io
4. ✅ Removed duplicate socket emissions from frontend
5. ✅ Attached Socket.io instance to Express app for controller access
6. ✅ Adjusted column height from 520px to 450px
7. ✅ Fixed package.json packageManager field issue (removed invalid pnpm entry)
8. ✅ Populated activity userId before emitting to frontend
9. ✅ Fixed Node.js console output piping in server.py for better debugging
10. ✅ Verified activity logging working correctly for all card operations

## Known Issues
1. ⚠️ GlassyKanbanBoard not rendering (old board design showing instead) - Frontend issue
2. ⚠️ Need to verify card creation dialog opens correctly - Frontend issue

## Next Steps
1. ✅ ~~Backend testing for card CRUD operations and activity logging~~ - COMPLETED
2. Frontend testing for card UI interactions
3. Test card persistence after page reload (frontend)
4. Test activity feed real-time updates (frontend)
5. Debug why GlassyKanbanBoard is not rendering (frontend)

## Testing Notes
- Services running locally on ports 3000 (frontend) and 8001/8002 (backend)
- Nginx configured on port 80
- Firebase Auth integrated with client-side
- Backend test file: /app/backend_test.py
- All backend APIs tested and verified working
